- Check if minimap2 SNIFFLES vs LAST NanoSV gives a different number of OOF exon-exon fusions
- Create figures on simulated dataset (Minimap2 NanoSV, Minimap2 Sniffles, LAST NanoSV)
- Automate when NanoFG performs consensus calling and when notations
  - If contig is empty, map all the reads but tag that they're detected without consensus calling

- Put original vcf as output? --> Remapped with LAST
